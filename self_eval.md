# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

**Mostly I struggled with time. I had fallen a bit behind today and felt pressured to try and catch up. However, this lesson material came to me pretty quickly and I felt confident while doing it.**

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

**I am not in my normal office setup at the moment and that has caused some note taking challenges. I don't have my colored pens or other supplies, just notepad and paper. Once I'm in my new apartment and have my office setup, I think I will be better prepared to take higher quality notes during Mod 1. I plan on going back through the lessons and taking more detailed notes with any leftover time this afternoon.**

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

**With this lesson, I did not need to go to google as much as previous lessons. I have used google extensively in past lessons when I couldn't intuit a problem on my own.**
